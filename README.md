# DeepFake-Detection
A Deepfake Detection System leveraging ExceptionNet and ResNet employs deep learning models to identify manipulated media. ExceptionNet captures intricate facial anomalies, while ResNet focuses on feature extraction and classification. The system processes input videos or images, extracts frames, and analyzes them using both models.
